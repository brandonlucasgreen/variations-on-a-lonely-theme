Variations on a Lonely Theme
for 5-string electric bass and live electronics
composed by Brandon Green, winter 2009

This patch was created by Brandon Green, with the assistance of Mike Frengel. The patch acts a live performance aid to the bass performer, providing tempo indicators, live processing of the bass signal, as well as several pre-recorded sounds to be triggered by a MIDI foot pedeal.

To use the patch for a performance:

1) Open the main patcher. (Hey, you've already done this)

2) Open the "DSP Settings" to configure your audio interface. Buffer settings should be set at the lowest possible, to allow for near-instant live processing.

3) Click on the "open index list" button to load the pre-recorded cues into the patch. When you are prompted to open a file, choose "VoaLT_sounds.txt". This is a text file that instructs the patcher what sounds to play at what given cue.

4) Test your MIDI foot pedal, and when functional, the "MIDI input" light will flash. Once the pedal is recognized by the patcher, selected "pedal online" to use in the patch.

5) Finally, toggle on Audio by clicking on the "audio on/off" button. This will turn on the bass signal in the patch. 

6) The work starts at cue #1. Tap the MIDI foot pedal once to reach this first cue. For rehearsal purposes, a "rehearsal skip" drop-down menu is provided to skip to different cues.
